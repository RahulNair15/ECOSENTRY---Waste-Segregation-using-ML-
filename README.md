##  ECOSENTRY - Waste Segregation using ML 

**Problem Statement:**
- Despite advancements in waste management practices, the process of waste segregation remains largely manual and prone to inefficiencies. 
- Traditional methods rely on human labor, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and often fails to achieve optimal recycling rates. 
- To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for automated waste segregation solutions that can accurately classify waste materials as recyclable or non-recyclable in real-time.
